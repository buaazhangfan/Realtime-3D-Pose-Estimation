# Single Camera based Realtime-3D-Pose-Estimation


This is the project for ***097457 VISION BASED 3D MEASUREMENTS*** at Politecnico di Milano in the Fall 2017.

Our project aims to building a system to estimate 3D Pose (6 DOFs) of an geometry-given object in space with only one camera using ***Solve P3P Algorithm***

In most cases, if you want to get the 3D coordinates of an object you need two cameras to get images, but when you get the geometry imformation of an object you can do this with only one camera.

This project consists of camera calibration, image acquistion, image processing, image segmentation, pose estimation and simple 3D reconstruction.
